    <p class="blog1-paragraph">
        "What’s on your mind?" That question often lingers after a long hike. For me, it conjures up the raw, winding trail carved into the spine of Cebu—the Cebu Highlands Trail (CHT). Not just a path, but a personal testament, a labor of love served on a silver platter, filled with imperfections, and yet brimming with untamed beauty.

On January 17, 2017, I took my first steps from Liloan Point in Santander, heading north toward Bulalaqui Point in Daanbantayan—Cebu’s finisterre. This would be no ordinary hike. Inspired by the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, and the Camino de Santiago, the Cebu Highlands Trail was born out of a dream most of us think impossible. But why not bring the dream home? Cebu’s natural shape, though modest in elevation, is perfect in length and character.

The CHT traces its origin to a humble dayhike on February 20, 2011, from Lutopan, Toledo City to Guadalupe, Cebu City. That one hike grew into a vision—an alternative brand of tourism that reveals a different side of Cebu, one not seen through resorts and beaches, but through steep ridges, sun-drenched trails, and the quiet strength of local communities.

The CHT is not about vertical feats or postcard views. It’s about the weight on your back, the distance under your boots, and the warmth of a stranger’s hospitality. At 408.29 kilometers with a humble 954-meter elevation gain, its true test is mental and emotional endurance. You might go hungry, but you’re never truly lost. The trail lets you pause, retreat, and return—as if repaying a debt in small, deliberate installments.

During its exploration phase, we relied on tradition, not tech—no GPS, just instincts, maps, and handwritten notes. Later, the trail was manually mapped on Wikiloc. It’s far from perfect, and that’s part of its soul.

The Thruhike was a logistical and spiritual undertaking. With Jonathaniel Apurado by my side, we raised funds through friends, local businesses, and kindred spirits. Brands like Classic Blade Exchange, Galileo Satellite Control Systems Philippines, Tech1 Corporation, Silangan Outdoor Equipment, and Viajero Outdoor Centre stepped in to support a vision not yet validated by infrastructure.

Support came in many forms: hiking shoes from the Middle East, herbal supplements, sleep pads, food drops coordinated by Markus Immer, and a community of believers sharing gear, time, and encouragement. Bloggers amplified our call, hikers pledged solidarity, and government officials offered recognition.

By November 25, 2016, the Cebu Provincial Government, through Gov. Hilario Davide III and Tourism Officer Joselito Costas, acknowledged the project’s potential. They listened, and I shared my hopes—including a book I was writing: A Warrior’s Pilgrimage: The Making of the Cebu Highlands Trail. The Thruhike would complete its final chapter.

Guest hikers joined along various legs, spending nights under stars, catching glimpses of what a full Thruhike would demand. This was more than just physical challenge—it was cultural immersion, spiritual reconnection, and the first spark of a legacy.

Will the Cebu Highlands Trail be adopted by the province? That remains to be seen. It needs funding, community involvement, and infrastructure. But its spirit—its essence—already belongs to those who dared walk it. The outdoor community has the skill, heart, and passion to nurture it into something even greater.

As for me, I’ve done my part. From concept to footpath, I connected the dots, powered by ancestral grit and divine providence. I walked not just to mark a trail, but to ignite a future.

When I finally place a token from Santander on the shores of Bulalaqui Point, I will begin a tradition—one that outlives me. The Cebu Highlands Trail will endure, not because of me, but because someone else will take that first step, feel that same hunger, and find their own story written in the dirt.

Let it be known: this trail was born out of faith, carried by community, and destined to become part of Cebu’s soul.
