        <h2>Tropical Bushcraft and Survival: 3 Days, 2 Nights Training</h2>
        <p>I took part in a 3-day bushcraft and survival training at Babag Mountain Range in Cebu City, led by Jing Lavilles de Egurrola. The program focused on key survival skills such as ethical bushcraft, knife safety, fire-making, foraging, and nocturnal hunting, all under the theme "Live in Defiance on All That Is Bad Around Us." This immersive experience significantly enhanced my survival abilities and deepened my understanding of sustainable living in the wild.</p>
