    <h1 class="blog1-title">Tropical Bushcraft and Survival: 3 Days, 2 Nights Training</h1>
    <p class="blog1-paragraph">
        In November 2024, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in a three-day bushcraft and survival training at the Babag Mountain Range in Cebu City, organized by Camp Red. The event, aptly titled "Live in Defiance on All That Is Bad Around Us," focused on developing the fundamental skills needed to thrive in the wilderness, with a strong emphasis on ethical bushcraft practices. From the moment I arrived at the camp, the excitement was palpable as we prepared ourselves for the challenges that lay ahead. The training was a unique blend of theory and hands-on experience, designed to push each participant out of their comfort zone and into a deeper understanding of survival techniques in the wild.

        Over the course of three days, we immersed ourselves in the intricacies of bushcraft, learning essential skills such as knife care and safety, foraging for wild edibles, and mastering fire-making techniques under varying conditions. One of the most memorable parts of the training was the nocturnal hunting exercise, where we were required to fast during the day and test our survival instincts by hunting for food at night. This not only honed our practical survival skills but also pushed us to rely on our senses and intuition in a way that few other experiences could replicate. The days were filled with lectures on various topics, including plant identification, fire safety, food preservation, and the ethical considerations of bushcraft. Evenings around the campfire brought us together for storytelling and sharing experiences, solidifying the camaraderie among the participants.
        
        The event also included several workshops focused on traditional navigation techniques and wilderness ethics, which are core components of the bushcraft community. We explored the importance of respecting nature, adhering to the principles of Leave No Trace, and understanding the value of self-sufficiency in the outdoors. The knowledge shared during this event was invaluable, not only for survival in harsh conditions but also for fostering a deeper connection with nature. By the end of the camp, I left with a newfound respect for the natural world, a greater sense of preparedness, and lifelong skills that I could apply to future adventures in the wilderness.
        
        The training was a transformative experience, both physically and mentally. It reinforced the importance of resilience, resourcefulness, and respect for the environment. The lessons learned over those three days are ones I will carry with me throughout my future expeditions, and Iâ€™m grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such an enriching and challenging bushcraft adventure.
